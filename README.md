# python-challenge - Py Me Up, Charlie


PyBank

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 


My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


In addition, my final scrip prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.



PyPoll



In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.


I was give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election based on popular vote.


My final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
